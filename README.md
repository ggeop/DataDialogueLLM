      ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to the Data Dialogue Preview! ðŸš€

      We're excited to have you here! ðŸŒŸ Data Dialogue is currently in its preview phase, 
      which means you're getting an early look at our innovative AI-powered data interaction tool.

      ðŸ’¡ Your feedback is golden! If you spot anything unusual or have ideas for improvement, 
         please don't hesitate to let us know. Together, we're building something amazing!


Data Dialogue is an advanced application that leverages AI to create prompts, retrieve data from various sources, and generate responses using an LLM backend. It's designed to run in Docker and consists of two main services: the LLM backend and the UI.

### Demo ðŸ‘‡

Try our demo by clicking the "Try Demo" button. The demo mode loads an open-source DVD database (PostgreSQL) for testing and experimentation. We provide several example prompts to get you started, but you're welcome to create your own custom prompts.
The system supports both open-source language models from HuggingFace and commercial LLMs (such as Google Gemini).


   Google Gemini provides a FREE API [get key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
   If your machine doesn't have enough processing power to run local HuggingFace models effectively, commercial LLMs are a great alternative.
